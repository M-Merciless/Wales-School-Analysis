Primaries {.storyboard}
=======================================================================



### Primary Phase: Individual Schools Budget vs Pupil Numbers

```{r primary_phaseplot}

primary_static <- cleansedprimaries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pupil_Numbers, y = `ISB(£_Thousands)`, label = schoolname)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(primary_static)
 
```



### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r Prim_Model, options}

primary_model <- phase_padjusted %>% 
  filter(Phase == "Primary")
primary_model


```
The regression shows that for the primary phase in Welsh schools, each individual student increases the Individual Schools Budget by £3,200. The p value returns a strong statistical significance (p adjusted = 0). Essentially, in 99.9% of cases, an increase in ISB is explained by an increase in pupil numbers. The standard error is extremely low, at a value of 0.0247. This means that on average, the model will be incorrect by £25 plus or minus the median value. 

Note that the nursery phase returned a non-significant p value and therefore was not analysed. This is likely due to the small number of nursery schools within Wales. 


### Interactive Data Table

```{r prim_datatable, options}
cleansedprimaries %>% 
  datatable(rownames = F,
            extensions = 'Buttons',
            options = list(
              dom = 'Bfrtip',
              buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
            ))

```

Secondaries {.storyboard}
======================================================================================

### Secondary Phase: Individual Schools Budget vs Pupil Numbers

```{r secondary_plotly, options}
secondary_static <- cleansedsecondary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pupil_Numbers, y = `ISB(£_Thousands)`, label = schoolname)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(secondary_static)

```

### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r Sec_Model, options}
secondary_model <- phase_padjusted %>% 
  filter(Phase == "Secondary")
secondary_model

```
The regression shows that for the secondary phase in Welsh schools, each individual student increases the Individual Schools Budget by £4,150. The p value returns a strong statistical significance (p adjusted = 1.38e-126). In 99.9% of cases, an increase in ISB is explained by an increase in pupil numbers. The standard error is extremely low for this phase, at a value of 0.0701. This means that on average, the model will be incorrect by £70 plus or minus the median value. 

### Interactive Data Table
```{r secondarydatatable, options}
cleansedsecondary %>% 
  datatable(rownames = F,
            extensions = 'Buttons',

              dom = 'Bfrtip',
              buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
            ))

```

Middles {.storyboard}
================================================================================


### Middle Phase: Individual Schools Budget vs Pupil Numbers

```{r middle_plotly}

middle_static <- cleansedmiddles %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Pupil_Numbers, y = `ISB(£_Thousands)`, label = schoolname)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(middle_static)
```



### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r Mid_Model, options}
middle_model <- phase_padjusted %>% 
  filter(Phase == "Middle")
middle_model

```

The regression shows that for the middle phase in Welsh schools, each individual student increases the Individual Schools Budget by £4,390. The p value returns a strong statistical significance (p adjusted = 2.53e-12). In 99.9% of cases, an increase in ISB is explained by an increase in pupil numbers. The standard error is very low, at a value of 0.24. This means that on average, the model will be incorrect by £224 plus or minus the median value. 

### Interactive Data Table

```{r middledatatable, options}
cleansedmiddles %>% 
  datatable(rownames = F,
            extensions = 'Buttons',
            options = list(
              dom = 'Bfrtip',
              buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
            ))

```

Specials {.storyboard}
========================================================================================


### Special Phase: Individual Schools Budget vs Pupil Numbers

```{r Special_plotly}

special_static <- cleansedspecial %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pupil_Numbers, y = `ISB(£_Thousands)`, label = schoolname)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(special_static)

```


### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r Spec_Model, options}
special_model <- phase_padjusted %>% 
  filter(Phase == "Special")
special_model

```
The regression shows that for the special phase in Welsh schools, each individual student increases the Individual Schools Budget by £18,300. The p value returns a strong statistical significance (p adjusted = 6.63e-13). In 99.9% of cases, an increase in ISB is explained by an increase in pupil numbers. 

However, the standard error is relatively larger than the other phases in this report, at a value of 1.63. This means that on average, the model will be incorrect by £1,630 plus or minus the median value. This increase in standard error is symptomatic of having a relatively small sample size in relation to the correlation coefficient and therefore would advise caution in drawing conclusions from this dataset.
